table,field,type,constraint,description
ecogroup_meta,,,,Contains descriptive data at the level of the ecogroup itself. Standardizing the code is useful due to some conflicts and duplicates which arise in the database without this standardization.
ecogroup_meta,ecogroup,text,primary key,The unique identifier of the ecogroup 
ecogroup_meta,groupname,text,,A more descriptive field for the ecogroup
ecogroup_meta,veg_type,text,,The types of vegetation that the ecogroup is composed of
ecogroup_meta,grouptype,text,,A descriptive label which defines the type of group or grouping process
ecogroup_meta,modal_site,text,,The standardized ecoclassid (###XY####ST) which is the modal site for the group (e.g. most area)
ecogroup_meta,published,boolean,,Has this group been published somewhere
ecogroup_meta,modeled,boolean,,Has the State and Transition Model (STM) been completed for this group
ecogroup_meta,model_status,text,,What is the status of the STM (e.g. final or draft)
ecogroup,,,,Contains the associations between ecological sites in the coecolass table and the ecogroup_meta table
ecogroup,ecoid,,primary key,"The standardized ecoclassid from the coecoclass table. The standardized code is the ecoclassid with the first character (‘R’, ‘F’, or ‘G’ etc.) removed and any trailing characters after the 2 character state code also removed. Standardization reduces join issues which can occur due to some ecological sites being duplicated in the database with different leading and trailing characters. "
ecogroup,ecogroup,,foreign key references ecogroup_meta(ecogroup),the ecogroup identifier associated with the ecological site
